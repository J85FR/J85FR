ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @J85FR

I'm located on west coast in France.

I've joined the community since I'm interested in:

- electronic devices
- can bus for home automation (see hapcan) and automotive (see wican) 
- PLC
- electronic cards design, microcontroller based
- software development (desktop applications for windows, embedded firmwares, android applications)

how I usually spend my time (I'm retired):
- design electronic cards (using Eagle software)
- design small systems (example: hive management using can bus weighing units, gsm data and Bluetooth communication)
- develop firmwares (using freertos+lwip on atmel arm microcontroller)
- develop applications in C++ (previously Delphi)
- start an approach on android with android studio

- skills: c++, assembler, sqlserver, mysql, birt, eagle, canbus, TCP/IP
- I've been working on access control products (hardware, softwar) for years.
- I usually make the maximum of repair operations on my vehicles, if possible,
(they are becoming computer-like now, so it's not easy, and electronics knowledge is nrecessary)

I want to find answers to questions and share experiences and projects in this community.
